MSBI Mastery Course project SSISCustomer

I recently completed a course on MSBI (Microsoft SQL Server Business Intelligence) that gave me hands-on experience with its three core components: SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS. Hereâ€™s an overview of the concepts, tools, and methods I learned:
SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)
Built ETL workflows, working with data flow and control flow.
Used tools like Conditional Split, Lookup, Merge Joins, and Script Task.
Explored advanced techniques such as transactions, checkpoints, error handling, and multithreading.
Gained experience with tasks like Data Profiling, XML, Web Services, and CDC (Change Data Capture).
SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services)
Learned to design multidimensional cubes and tabular models.
Worked with MDX queries, KPIs, calculated members, and aggregations.
Managed relationships, including many-to-many and reference relationships.
Explored hierarchical dimensions, perspectives, translations, and cube processing.
SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services)
Created interactive reports using tabular and matrix formats.
Worked with report parameters, sorting, expressions, and visual elements like charts and gauges.
Learned about SSRS architecture and deployment.
This course gave me a strong foundation in designing and implementing solutions with MSBI tools, preparing me to handle data integration, analysis, and reporting in professional projects.
